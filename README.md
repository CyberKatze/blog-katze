# BlogKatze
It's going to be a markdown blog for now, but later; Who knows?!!

## Todo
- [ ] Render markdown pages as a blog
- [ ] Profile Menu
- [ ] Tags and search
- [ ] Customized theme
- [ ] Graph to link pages
- [ ] Adding comment


## Getting started

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.
